THE CODE: RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION AND GREEN CONSUMPTION

🔗 The Idea

A recyled material supplier who can sell recycled resources directly to producers through a market place at competitive rates.


🔗 Summary

Circular economy is a systematic approach to economic development designed to benefit businesses, society and environment. 
The main aim of circular economy is to keep materials available instead of disposing them and thus closing the loop of
materials within the product lifecycle.

To ensure sustainability and mitigate climate change, continual use of resources should be empasized, keeping products, equipment
and infrastructure in use for a longer time.

 🔗 Benefits of circular economy

*Reducing pressure on environment
*Protection of natural resources
*Increase in energy efficient
*Reduction of carbon emissions
*Reducing production costs
*Stimulating innovation
*Creating jobs
*Increasing competitiveness
*Combating climate change 


Citing the seven key elements of circular economy there is need to change how we are doing things as far as combating climate change is concerned.
These elements include;
     # Prioritize regenerative resources
     # Preserve and extend what's already made
     # Use waste as a resource
     # Rethink the business model
     # Design for the future
     # Incorporate digital technology
     # Collaborate to create joint value

Looking keenly on the key elements, they are matching the code challenge expectations. There is the urge of coming together and come up with a sustainable
solution.


🔗 Development and business model

According to the World Business Council for sustainable development the main obstacle to by-product synergy is lack of a body(Platform) to link industries 
worldwide. 
By-product synergy will ensure waste is used as a resource. The waste of company "A" is used as a raw material for company "B" and vice versa. 
The development of the platform will locate and match wastes (by-products) with potential buyers worldwide. Industries will list their by-products and then
the platform will match the by-products with potential buyers who would use them as their raw materials. 
By applying this technology we shall divert waste going to the landfill and reduce carbon emissions thus combating climate change.
